#### About

I have been using FlexASIO for my music production needs. I used to configure with [flipswitchingmonkey's editor](https://github.com/flipswitchingmonkey/FlexASIO_GUI). However, I wanted to add additional functionality and a modern user interface (wanted dark mode).

I wanted to keep it lightweight and fast, so Tauri seemed like a decent tradeoff between making it easy for myself to develop and mantain, and making it pretty.

Built with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/). Uses components from [Fluent Svelte](https://fluent-svelte.vercel.app/)
