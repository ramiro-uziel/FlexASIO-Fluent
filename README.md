### Download
[Releases page](https://github.com/ramiro-uziel/FlexASIO-Fluent/releases/)

### Compatibility
This overwrites the registry entry made by FlexASIO GUI on install. This means that if you open a DAW or any other software that can call to open a configuration GUI, it will open this one. If you want to revert to FlexASIO GUI, uninstall this first, then reinstall FlexASIO GUI.

### About
I have been using FlexASIO for my music production needs, configuring it with [flipswitchingmonkey's editor](https://github.com/flipswitchingmonkey/FlexASIO_GUI). I wanted to add additional features and implement a modern user interface, including dark mode support. My main goal was to create an editor that would look and feel like a native Windows 11 application while maintaining the usability of the original FlexASIO GUI.

I wanted to have a balance between keeping it lightweight and making it simple to develop. Although Tauri's appeal is for cross-platform development, I think it produced a decently native-feeling Windows application.

Built with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/). Not possible without components from [Fluent Svelte](https://fluent-svelte.vercel.app/).
